Introduction
============

**Project Name:** ``SHINE``

``SHINE`` (Spectral Highlighting and Identification of Emission) is a simple Python-based script that identifies connected structures above a user-given signal-to-noise (S/N) threshold in 2D and 3D datasets.
It also allows masking bad regions where extraction should not be performed.

Installation
============

**Requirements:**

- Python version: ``>=3.8``
- Dependencies: ``numpy``, ``scipy``, ``astropy``, ``connected-components-3d``

**Steps to Install:**

1. Clone the repository:
   ::

       git clone https://github.com/matteofox/SHINE.git
       cd SHINE

2. Install the code:
   ::

       python -m pip install .


Directory Contents
==================
The github distribution includes a shine/ directory that contains the following codes:

- ``SHINE.py``: The main Python file containing the code for the extraction process.
- ``GUI_SHINE.py``: The Python file containing the code for the GUI.
- ``Make_Im_SHINE.py``: The Python file for the tool used to analyze the extraction results. It generates 2D images.


Usage of SHINE and tools
=================
``SHINE`` and ``Make_Im_SHINE`` are installed as executables and can be run directly from the terminal. Below is an explanation of the different ways to execute the code.

The extraction is performed using ``SHINE``. The basic idea behind the code is as follows:

1. (Optional, applicable to 3D data only) Select a portion of the cube (in the z-direction or wavelength direction) where the user wants to focus the extraction.
2. Mask certain voxels using a user-provided mask (e.g., continuum sources).
3. Spatially filter the cube/image and the associated 2D or 3D variance using a user-defined kernel dimension.
4. Apply a threshold to the cube/image based on the user-defined S/N threshold.
5. Group connected voxels (3D)/pixels (2D) that meet the S/N threshold and other user-defined parameters.
6. Generate and save the catalog along with the labeled cube/image.

For 3D data only, it is possible to use Make_Im_SHINE to create the associated image by collapsing the voxels in the z-direction using the labeled cube.
This tool is designed to create three different types of images (``flux``, ``mean`` or ``median``) both selecting only certain voxels based on a 3D mask with associated Ids (e.g. the output labels cube of ``SHINE``, thus creating an extraction image) and all the voxels (thus creating a narrow band image). If ``flux`` is selected, the units of the output image are :math:`1 \times 10^{-18} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1} \, cm^{-2} \, arcsec^{-2}}`.
Using a single Id object it is also possible to obtain an image with the representative pseudo narrow band around it (the width is specified by the user with ``--nsl`` and ``--nsladd``.
